    <p>
       With trade-offers you can trade with other people. If you get an offer, you have 14 days to accept or until the sender cancel the offer.  

There are many skins to every weapon, therefore the price also varies a lot from skin to skins. Some skins there are less of and therefore it will be a more expensive skin and vice versa. It's all about demand and supply. 

You can also use the steam market where you can buy or sell skins. There is a steam market fee though on 5% when selling a skin. 

<br> The way I usually trade is with cash with people on Facebook. There is a lot of trading groups on Facebook, the biggest Swedish group have roughly 55000 members. The buyers always go first by transferring the cash via Swish to the seller. Swish is an app where you can ‚Äúswish‚Äù people money. After transferring the cash, you then get the skin by a trade offer from the seller which you accept. This sounds easy but there are also scammers in these groups, so I will try to explain how you can minimize your chances of getting scammed. 

Before buying a skin, look up the person on the application you are using to buy/sell skins. Can you find any earlier posts from him or at least some evidence that he is serious about trading skins. I prefer to use Facebook because people use their real name on Facebook, that brings me to point out that you should always check that the transaction goes to the same name as the seller use on the forum to trade.  I prefer to ask the seller about pictures that proofs his or her earlier trades if he or she have traded earlier. 

 <h2>Scambot </h2>
<p>
‚ÄúScambot‚Äù is a phenomenon that showed up about two years ago, the way it works is that it‚Äôs a virus that connects itself to your steam API key, by connecting to the API key it can control your trade offers etc., basically if your steam account is infected by ‚Äúscambot‚Äù it will automatically redirect and accept trade offer to itself.  There are guides on the internet on how to get rid of ‚Äúscambot‚Äù  if your account is infected by it.
